# GitHub LGTM Chrome Extension

Automatically adds a random approval comment when you approve a GitHub pull request.

## What and why?

This extension saves you time during GitHub code reviews by automatically adding a random, pre-set approval comment (like “LGTM” or “Nice work!”) whenever you click the Approve button on a pull request. No need to type the same generic responses over and over—just approve, and the extension handles the rest.

Give it a try and let me know what you think!
